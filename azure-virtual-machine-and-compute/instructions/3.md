# Lab 04 - Backup and Recovery

### Estimated Duration: 30 Minutes

## Lab Scenario

You are a Cloud Administrator for Contoso Ltd., responsible for ensuring business continuity and disaster recovery for critical workloads. One of your production virtual machines must be protected so it can be restored quickly in case of accidental deletion, corruption, or a datacenter outage. In this lab, you will create an Azure Recovery Services Vault, configure it to back up the VM using an enhanced backup policy, and verify that backups are enabled. This setup will provide secure, point-in-time recovery options to safeguard business operations.

A virtual machine is protected by a locally redundant storage account, which means that it is replicated and only accessible to Microsoft in the event of a datacenter outage. In this lab, we will configure a separate backup of the VM that will be user-accessible for recovery.

This lab uses the **Azure Backup Recovery Services Vault** to back up the virtual machine with the configured policy, and will be charged as per-backup pricing. A Recovery Services vault is a logical container that stores the backup data for each protected resource, such as Azure VMs. When you enable a **Virtual Machine Backup** and the backup job for a protected resource runs, it creates a recovery point inside the Recovery Services vault. You can then use one of these recovery points to restore data to a given point in time. To learn more about **Azure Backup Recovery Services Vault**, follow the link.

## Objectives

In this lab you will complete the following task:

- Task 1: Create a Recovery Services vault
- Task 2: Enable Virtual Machine Backup

### Task 1: Create a Recovery Services vault

In this task, you will create a Recovery Services vault and configure backup for a virtual machine. This ensures that the VM’s data is securely stored and can be restored in case of data loss or system failure.

 1. Click on the **Hamburger menu (1)** at the upper left corner of the Azure portal and click on **All services (2)**.

### Task 2: Enable Virtual Machine Backup

In this task, you will enable backup for the VM DEMOLABVM01 by selecting an existing Recovery Services Vault, choosing the enhanced backup policy, and initiating the backup configuration.

1. On the **All resources** blade and Select **DEMOLABVM01**.
